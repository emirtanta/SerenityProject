				Serenity Project Report

I recommend reading the readme file before running the project.The project was made using both layered architecture and windows form application.Layered architecture consists of 4 layers.They consist of entity layer, data access layer, business layer and interface layer. I have used the Entity layer in both the web application and the windows form application.

I kept the database in the project in MS Sql.

I used the fluent validation method to check the correctness of the properties of the members class in the business layer. I downloaded it from nuget to be able to use this method in the interface layer as well.

I tried to make the desired features from the project. I didn't do it because adding the picture is optional.

You can review the script and sql bak files of the project on the github page.

I tried to do crud operations without using Entity Framework in windows form application.


Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I hope you like this project.
